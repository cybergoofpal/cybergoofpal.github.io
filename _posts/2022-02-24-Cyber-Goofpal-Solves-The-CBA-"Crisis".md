Honk, Honk!

Hello. I've been getting a lot of messages from randos to my anonymous email account asking me to come up with a plan to solve the MLB labor dispute. This makes sense as I have come up with solutions to a variety of vexing problems in the past. I don't want to brag, but I got Wordle in 5 tries one time. (It's annoying you can't use "whore" as a guess anymore; fuckin' New York Times). I also have shown incredible patience, as I once got through on a call to Southwest Airlines. So, yeah, I'm plenty qualified to fix this simple issue.

First, the owners need to open their books. Not their financial books of course, but their copies of Fifty Shades of Grey. This should put them in the right mindset for the beatdown they so richly deserve.

Second, The players have to stop asking for the moon. Nobody can give you the moon, players! Well maybe Jeff Bezos or one of those other douchey billionaires who go to space all the time, but they don't own a baseball team.

Everyone just wants baseball back, and by everyone, I mean the fans. The MLB and the MLBPA seem to like baseball, but not as much as "brinksmanship" or "chicken".

These negotiations have been a JOKE! They haven't even addressed mascot pay! Sure the mascot union isn't the strongest, as there is always some clown who crosses the picket line (literally a clown. I think Ronald McDonald did it once, fucking scab!).

So how do they solve this? Simple, have advertising patches on the uniforms like the players want, and those advertisers each have to pay any player wearing their ad the MLB minimum the players want of $775K. Any players making more than the minimum will get the difference from a Go-Fund-Me page that the owners set up. (And they will also be required to "play better" than the league minimum players)

The owners want expanded playoffs, well buckle up because everyone makes it! The playoffs start on opening day! How has nobody thought of this before? Each team plays a best of 30 series to advance to a best of 20, and so on and so forth. There would have to be a loser's bracket of course, and the winner of that bracket would still get a trophy, but it would be shorter and less impressive than the actual World Series trophy, maybe a Grammy or a Tony.

Both sides seem to agree that there should be a lottery for draft picks. This makes sense, but I've been told it's really hard to win the lottery. Maybe they could start with pull tabs and work their way up. I'm just spit-balling on this one.

Lastly, both sides have agreed upon having a pool of money for non-arbitration players who win awards and such. The problem is that they can't agree on a total. The players want too much and the owners want to little. They are missing an obvious solution: use smaller denomination bills. If you fill the pool with 10s and 20s of course it won't be enough. Fill it with 5s and 1s and it will be plenty full for money swimming. Alternatively use coins like Scrooge McDuck.

As stupid as you may think many of these ideas are, they all beat missing regular season games. C'mon fellas, get it fixed!!!
