Honk, honk! 

Hello cinephiles (that term is not as offensive as you may think at first blush).  Today I’m reviewing Oppenheimer, which is nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture.   I have to warn you, if you haven’t seen the movie, or have no concept of US history (like we won WWII and dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki) there will be some spoilers here. 

Oppenheimer, came out at the same time as the Barbie movie which is also nominated for best picture.  Anyone who has seen Margot Robbie in The Wolf of Wall Street and a nude Barbie doll knows that Barbie is not historically accurate, but Oppenheimer for the most part is (Cocaine Bear falls somewhere in between, but was shockingly snubbed for Best Picture).   

The movie stars Cillian Murphy as Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.  (Sidebar: Not to be confused with Julius Erving who also dropped some bombs in the 80’s ad Dr. J).   

You may know Cillian (pronounced KILL-e-uhn) from Peaky Blinders. He smokes a lot and kills people in that show.  In this movie he takes those things to a whole new level while wearing an old-timey hat.     

The movie chronicles  Dr. J’s life and the development of the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project (Sidebar: What a brilliant codename for a secret weapon development program.  If the Axis powers got wind of it they would probably think it was for low income housing in New York).   

Being historically accurate there’s no car chases, shoot outs, or explosions (except for, well, you know).  The main backdrop of the movie is a 1954 security clearance hearing shot in black and white, so yeah, the excitement meter pegs out at just under 1. 

Dr. J meets with the likes of Einstein (later famous for the bagels he developed with his brother), Werner Heisenberg (who ultimately starred in Breaking Bad) as well as Harry S Truman who (spoiler alert!) has a middle name of S which doesn’t stand for anything, just S (look it up if you don’t believe me, I’ll wait).   

Harry S Truman was the president at the time for those of you who are “history challenged” and made the decision to drop both nukes.  In the movie (and in real life) Harry S called Dr. J a “crybaby scientist” for saying that he had blood on his hands over development of the bomb.  This is where some artistic license would’ve been welcomed by me.  How much better would it have been if he called him a cotton-headed ninny-muggins? 

The Manhattan Project team was lead by Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon.   At one point in the movie it is revealed that Leslie Groves attended MIT.  What’s the deal with Matt Damon characters and MIT?  I was waiting for him to ask the Japanese how they liked those apples (sadly, he did not because that would’ve been hilarious).   

Robert Downey Jr. is also in the movie as Lewis Strauss, the “bad guy”. (no, the guy who developed the atomic bomb that killed hundreds of thousands of people is not the bad guy.) (Sidebar: Isn’t it weird when the Jr. is more well-known than the Sr.? Cal Ripken, Sammy Davis, Joey Jo-Jo Shabadoo.).  Anyhoo, Lewis Strauss (no relation to Levi Strauss) tried to smear Dr. J, and would’ve gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for these meddling film-makers!  In the end, (spoiler alert!) we win the war, have a 50 year cold war with the Russians, and 30+ years later make this movie. 

I actually love true stories, and although this was an ungodly 3 hours long, it really was excellent.  I give it 4 out of 5 honks.
