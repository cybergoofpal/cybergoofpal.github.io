Honk, honk!

I thought I’d take some time to explain the ongoing feud between Aaron Rodgers and Jimmy Kimmel for those of you that don’t have the time to navigate the multiple articles written about this.  In this story there is a smug, arrogant, know-it-all as well as a smug, arrogant, know-it-all.  You can decide which is which.

Dr. Aaron Rodgers, for those of you who don’t know, is a highly successful football player who spent many years playing for the Green Bay Packers.  Unfortunately for the Packers (and more so the Jets) Aaron happened upon the Brett Favre Packer playbook which includes threatening to retire, airing your grievances with the team and management in the media, and ultimately requiring to be traded.  The Packers traded Rodgers to the Jets just in time for him to completely lose his mind.

Upon arriving at the Jets training camp I imagine the conversation went something like this:

**Jets Management**: Aaron, welcome aboard!  We’re excited to have you join our organization, which we like to think of as a family.

**Aaron**: Yeah, that doesn’t work for me.  I’m not on speaking terms with my actual family so I’m going to need a shift in this paradigm.  Maybe instead of a family, we could look at it as a group of individuals working towards a common goal, led by me, with you catering to my every whim.

**Jets Management**: Uh, yeah, I guess we…

**Aaron**: Great.  For starters, lets sign a bunch of my buddies from the Packers whether they can actually help the team or not. Randall Cobb would be a good start.

**Jets Management**:  Sure, I mean we have 53 spots on the roster, certainly we can burn a few if it keeps you happy.

I forgot to mention an important thing that happened before this trade.  If you were following the news closely in 2020 you may have heard of the “Corona virus”, no this wasn’t a catchy Mexican beer marketing campaign, but a global pandemic.  All those people walking around with masks on weren’t doing it as a fashion statement where people wanted to look like a dollar store version of Daft Punk, it was mandated in most public places.  
Sidebar: (I wonder if the Daft Punk guys had a problem getting through TSA with those helmets on.)

**TSA Agent**: Sir, you’re going to have to take off that mask.

**Daft Punk guy**: But masks are required to be worn at all times inside the airport and on flights.

**TSA Agent**: Uh, well, I guess that’s true.

**Daft Punk guy**: These aren’t the droids you’re looking for.

**TSA Agent**: These aren’t the droids we are looking for, move along. 

During this time the vaccinations were all the rage, and in a press conference Aaron was asked if he was vaccinated, to which he replied that he had indeed been immunized.  Apparently, Aaron thought that the NFL was concerned that he may get the mumps.  

It later came out that Aaron was against the vaccine and was doing his own homeopathic cures such as injecting bleach and chewing mushrooms in the dark.  I also neglected to mention that Aaron is super-duper smart.  He was accepted at the prestigious Butte College and at one time hosted Jeopardy! where the host needs to know all of the answers. Sidebar: (I’m told that actually the answers are all on those little index cards they have.)

Anyhoo, his vaccine-hesitancy, man bun, and general know-it-all-ness made him a target for Jimmy Kimmel, whose job it is to make jokes (typically at a famous person’s expense).  Aaron didn’t take too kindly to this, because although he is a tough NFL player, he has skin as thin as rice paper.

When the season started, Aaron tore his Achillies tendon four plays into his tenure with the Jets.   By using a “speed bridge” surgical procedure, injections of platelet rich plasma, and running his mouth on the Pat McAfee Show, his rehab timeline had him hoping to be back in time for the Jets playoff run.  It was at this point that he was notified that “Jets Playoff Run” is akin to “Bigfoot Senate Run”, so he helped the team as best he could by not being a distraction.

While he was definitely not being a distraction, he appeared on the Pat McAfee show every week to talk sports.  If you’ve never seen the Pat McAffee show it’s a bit like  a high school locker room with less fart lighting. The production values are similar to what you would expect from a 6 year old filming it with an iphone. 

This may sound crazy, but in a clearly sports-related discussion, Aaron said “There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel are really hoping that doesn't come out.” Referring, to the list that was to come out about people who pedophile Jeffery Epstein had entertained at his island.  The implication here (for those of you who didn’t attend Butte College) is that Kimmel is some sort of pedophile.  

Jimmy got the message, and was none too amused.  He threatened legal action and demanded an apology, which, as you probably guessed, he didn’t get.  
Aaron said, and I’m quoting here because if we’ve learned anything about him is that he chooses his words very carefully: 

>"I’m not stupid enough to accuse you of that with absolutely zero evidence, concrete evidence. That’s ridiculous.” 

If you’re keeping score at home, Aaron is too smart to say what he said.

The problem here for me, you, and everyone else who didn’t attend Butte College, is that Aaron is clearly on another level “smarty-wise” and we’re just having trouble keeping up.
It’s unfortunate that he’ll likely spend the off-season rehabbing to prepare for his 5th snap (and beyond) for the Jets, when the world could really use him to solve cold fusion to mitigate climate change.
