Honk, honk!

For my regular readers (both of you), you’ll remember that 2023 was the first year of the formal Joe Winkelsas award competition.

"What is the Joe Winkelsas Award? "you ask. I’m glad you did, or this would be a really short post. The Joe Winkelsas Award is a highly prestigious award given to the Brewers reliever that eats the most pointless MLB garbage innings at the most cost-conscious price point. Named after a former Brewer reliever who actually worked as a garbage man (true story).

"Goofpal, what are "pointless MLB garbage innings?" Well, you’re just full of questions, aren’t you? MLB garbage innings, (as defined by me) are ones where a reliever comes into a game with the team either up by 5 or more runs, or down by 4 or more runs. The difference here is that Greg Cancel, and now Mailbox Face are loathe to have to bring in Devin Williams in a game that they could win without him, therefore they still use a "goodish" reliever with a 4 run lead, but a Javy Guerra-esque tomato can when up by 5.

The qualifying reliever who accrues the most "cost-effective" JWA innings is the winner. I use Sportrac to get real-time player salaries. This is important, as many of the participants spend some time in Nashville, and while not adding JWA innings, they are also not getting paid.

A tweak this year will be how to determine qualifiers. Last year I figured 1 JWA inning per every 10 games played would make sense. So to qualify at the end of the season you would have needed to pitch 16 JWA innings. Although there were 26 pitchers who pitched a total of 127 2/3 JWA innings last year, this metric led to a grand total of 1 qualifier, Bryce Wilson.

Bryce threw an incredible 21 JWA for the low, low price of just $34,885.71 each. His performance epitomizes what this award is all about. What can I say about Bryce that hasn’t already been said? Probably quite a bit. He’s kind of a garden-variety middle reliever who’s name you’ll forget in a couple of years because he’s really "just a guy".

Anyhoo, it occurred to me during my morning constitution that a percentage of the team’s JWA IP would make more sense. Therefore, to qualify this year, the player will have had to have thrown 10% of the current JWA innings. This is still a high bar as it only would’ve added Trevor Megill (12 JWA IP) to last year’s qualifiers.

It’s with this information that I ask you to predict this year’s winner. I caution you, this is not easy. I suspect there will be more JWA IP this year and they will be distributed more evenly. Furthermore, Bryce Wilson’s salary is now $1MM so he’ll have to pitch a lot more JWA innings to keep up with the likes of JB Bukauskas and Thyago Vieira (who I nicknamed the Thy-master last year, although it’s apparently pronounced "chi-ago". Chi-master just doesn’t have the same ring to it).

I’m going to go with a dark horse this year: Janson Junk.

All correct answers get a platinum membership at [cybergoofpal.fun](https://cybergoofpal.fun/), your source for all things nonsense. You should check it out. It has fewer articles than BCB and fewer comments than Brewer Fanatic, really the total package. Plus it includes non-baseball articles [like this](https://cybergoofpal.fun/cyber-goofpal-reviews-oppenheimer). 

Yours Honkily,
