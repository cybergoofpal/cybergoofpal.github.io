Honk, honk!

As most of my loyal readers know I've been learning the intricacies of the game over the last couple of years. The Brewers front office have really shown me some impressive personnel chess moves in that time. Unfortunately other teams were doing baseball personnel moves.

What the casual fan misses is the incredible mis-direction that the FO does to confuse other teams. They trade Chase Anderson in 2019 knowing full well they would need to win this weekend, and who do they face but a used-up Chase Anderson. Sure they got only 1 hit in 4 innings, but they won. This is playing the "long game".

The best example of their mis-direction was this year's trade deadline. Everyone was all upset they traded Josh Hader in a flurry of moves.

But this week you'll see what that was all about. This week your eyes will be opened. This week you will slap the side of your head (much like those old V-8 commercials). This week you will say "Come to think of it, I'll have a Heineken" (wait, what?). This is the week that all will be revealed.

Because while everyone was gnashing their teeth that Hader was gone. While everyone was wondering if Taylor Rogers was any good (or better than his evil twin). While everyone was wondering what the hell they were doing giving Trevor Rosenthal all that money to be hurt and never play again. While everyone was wondering why they cut Dinelson Lamet after they traded for him (and subsequently hurt his feelings). While all of this was going on, they were quietly making the move that will save their season. I'm of course referring to "resting" their most potent of secret weapons, Jandel Gustave.

You may remember that Gustave went on the IL with an "injury" to make room for Matt F'ing Bush. Well, I have it on good authority (Barrellman let it slip after his 6th old fashioned) that Gustave was sent to the pitching lab to learn to pitch with either arm. He has been watching video of Pat Venditte, and got a reversible glove! The Cardinals, Mets, and Yankees won't know what hit them. Look for him to pitch in every game for the rest of the year. One day right handed, the next day left. Counsell says they are doing a bullpen day, bullshit!!! its all Gustave, all the time.

Sure he'll probably burn out before the playoffs, but meanwhile Lauer, Peralta, Lindblom will all be getting stronger! Then we'll see who f'ed up the trade deadline!

Peace!

Yours Honkily,
