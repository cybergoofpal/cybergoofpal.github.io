Honk, honk!

I promised that I'd give an update on this during the all-star break when I have some time. The pet store is kind of slow this morning and last night was also slow. Hoping to see a customer this month. Here goes.

Removing all of the guys who have left the 40 man roster (or the organization completely, i.e. Gus Varland, thank you Jesus) the leaderboard is below. I should note that to qualify a player must have 1 JWA IP for every 10 games played, or a total of at least 16 by the end of the year.

Currently the only qualifier is Bryse Wilson mostly by virtue of his (2) 3 IP Bullshine saves early in the season when the Brewers had a 10 run lead both times. Those 2 games alone get him in the top 4.

Hoby Milner is #2 but actually has the most appearances (9) in mop up time.

I still think Trevor Megill pulls this out by the end of the season by virtue of Wilson getting some high-ish leverage innings and Megill having good potential but stinking up the joint.

Also remember, it's not the quantity of JWA IP but the dollar value the guy brings. If Megill ends up qualifying he'll almost certainly be cheaper than Wilson.

As usual we all hope that the players just have fun out there. You are playing a kid's game for millions of dollars, this isn't something serious like Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest!
