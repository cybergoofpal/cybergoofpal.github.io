Honk, honk! Thank you all for submitting your questions for my off-season mailbag. They were adequately weird. Let's get started.

**MrLeam** asked: Why go with Cyber Goofpal and not Fecal Bop Orgy?

and

**AIMaFi** asked: Did you ever save a link to that game thread where IIRC the whole "cyber goofball" thing came up? Wasn't it someone who went on a wild tirade in Summer 2021?

**Honk, honk**: I didn't come up with the name Cyber Goofpal. On July 7th 2021 there was a "wild tirade" by a poster who was very enamored with important statistics like RBIs and batting average. He was lashing out at many of the regular posters here. I believe that he called Sandy a dolphin and Captain What's His Name "soy boy". Junbug and others piled on and he was mad at them and their "Cyber Goofpals". Sadly I couldn't find the comments section since Tanya f'ed this site up. If anyone has a way to retrieve that link, it was delicious.

**Duckbroh** asked: Why 42?

**Honk, honk**: Simple, 41 was too little, and 43 was, how can I put this gently? A bit to uppity.

**Secret Stadium Sauce (with help from Nancy Kerrigan)** asked: Why?

**Honk, honk**: Because.

**Harvye Hodja** asked: Gunter glieben glauchen globen?

H**Honk, honk**: This a bit of a stumper. I thought the answer may be in Harvye's Pioneer League 1996 fanpost, but I couldn't, for the life of me, finish it. No offense Harvye, you clearly had something to say. I guess it's better to burn out than to fade away.

**Captain What's His Name** asked: What kind of deal do you think Gustave gets this off-season? Why is he still available?

**Honk, honk**: I thought he'd be off the board by now. With the deals dolled out to Judge and Correa all I can figure is that he is holding out for a 10+ year contract. Wherever he ends up he should age like fine cream.

**RockChalkBrewhawk** asked: I was wondering if you would consider posting a weekly in depth analysis of how the Brewers are doing this season specifically focusing on fringe bullpen guys since you seem to have such an unbiased intelligent opinion on this topic.

**Honk, honk**: I have considered this. I can't be bothered to do anything on a regular basis, but I will provide semi-irregular updates on the Joe Winklesas award standings this year.

**Brew Crew Buster** asked: If you had to pick one person to hang out with in an MLB bullpen, who would it be and why?

**Honk, honk**: Gal Gadot because she's a stone-cold smoke-show!!! I know where you were going with this one Buster, Obviously Brent Suter, but all- time, Dan Quisenberry.

**Spaul149** asked: What is the worst type of Music between bagpipes, polka, or EDM? Feel free to insert your own

**Honk, honk**: Two words, Steely Dan.

**Brew Crew Buster** asked: How do you think the MLB playerâ€™s union got to the decision to create a union for minor league players?

**Honk, honk**: I reckon they were inspired by the Starbucks' unions popping up all over the country, given that Starbucks employees are paid more than MiLB players. I got a Venti Mocha Latte with Oat Milk yesterday for $74.50, but it was delicious!!!!

**Leche010** asked: How's Denver treating ya?

**Honk, honk**: It's not that different than Milwaukee really. I had some brownies that tasted kind of funny yesterday, and the next thing I knew I was in a van with Daniel Norris. Not sure if he is planning on signing with the Rockies too, but he could because he's terrible.

And finally:

**Mcmurray5.15** asked: Hey Goofpal, In a best of seven series of no holds barred thumb war (conducted in the only possible attire 70's disco apparel), who taking home this years prize? Taylor Bolden or Leche10?


**Honk, honk**: Trick question Mcmurray. It would be a tie. Why? Wait for it........They are the same guy!!!

Taylor Bolden is actually Tyler Durden!!

We have all been fooled by this ruse for the last couple of years. (On the plus side I don't believe that I've used any soap made from medical waste).

Do you know why they haven't told us about it? That would break the FIRST rule!!!


Happy Holidays all, and to all a good night!!
