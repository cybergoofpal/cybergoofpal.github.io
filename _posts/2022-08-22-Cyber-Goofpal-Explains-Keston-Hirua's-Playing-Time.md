Honk, honk!

Howdy kids! I've been fielding a lot of questions on the Brewers' handling of Keston Hiura this year, and unlike Christian Yelich I'm going to transfer from catching them to replying (If you know what I mean).

It seems that many fans think Keston should be playing more. What these fans fail to realize is that his player profile doesn't fit what the Brewers are trying to accomplish. This team is a run-prevention team with "our getters" and "belly itchers". Keston currently leads the team in OPS. That's NOT run-prevention! In fact it's quite the opposite.

Not sure if it's coaching, or just that Keston's not on the "same page" as management (Page 69 of Fifty Shades of Gray) but he is consistently providing runs rather than preventing them.

Yesterday, as the DH he didn't prevent a single run, while Andrew McCutchen, the normal DH, expertly prevented a run by getting caught stealing right before a Rowdy HR. Way to go Cutch! You're getting it!

In the coming weeks you'll probably see Keston get some more playing time due to fan pressure, analytics, and "common sense" but the stats show when he plays, more runs are scored.

Eventually his massive strikeout rate will catch up to him and he'll be just as bad as all of the other hitters on the team, you just wait and see!

In the meantime, keep up the positive attitude Keston, you are an inspiration to us all, except for maybe Eric Lauer.

Yours Honkily,
