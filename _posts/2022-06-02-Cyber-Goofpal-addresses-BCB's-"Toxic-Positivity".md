Honk, honk!

As you all know, like Will Smith, I'm a vessel of love. Therefore, some of the commentary on the game threads has got a bit too "chippy" for me lately. It seems that many of the commentariat are just too F'ing positive.

Sure this is the best start in the history of the team, but does that mean the team and management know what they're doing? Of course not! Craig Counsell is a graduate of Whitefish Bay Dominican High School, so yeah, he's no Alex Einstein!

We all make mistakes. You'll remember that I called for the Brewers to trade for Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani in the off season, but the team didn't do it. Turns out they were right. Mike Trout is a terrible fantasy football commissioner! It's this kind of "inside information" that guys like David Stearns have that normal Jamokes like us don't. He may have even had an inkling that Tommy Pham and Joc Pederson are flaming ass-hats too.

The positive guys are all like "Hunter Renfroe is better than this list of guys they could've signed in the off-season". OH YEAH? Well, So What!!! Just because this worked out awesome, doesn't mean that the Brewers aren't cheap sons of bitches. Long term high dollar free agent signings are how you build a team, just ask Lorenzo Cain.

As the great humanitarian Rodney King once said "Can't we all just get along?" I love this community and it pains me to see BCB on BCB crime. Seriously, Let's clean it up fellas, and Oh, yeah, fuck Tanya!!!

Yours Honkily,
