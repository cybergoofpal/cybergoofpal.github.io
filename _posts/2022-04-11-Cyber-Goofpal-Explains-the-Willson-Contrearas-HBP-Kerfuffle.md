Honk, honk!

A lot has been made of this weekend's dustup between the Brewers and Cubs after the Cubs intentionally hit Andrew McCutchen as retaliation for multiple HBPs by the the Brewers staff, specifically hitting Willson Contreras for the millionth time.

Here's what I think: The Brewers aren't hitting Contreras because he stands too close to the plate and tries to get hit; They're not hitting him because he's a pretty good hitter if you concede the inside of the plate, or because he's a pissy little bitch. It's a combination of all of these.

You can understand why the Cubs and their fans are mad. The Brewers owned their asses last year, and now they are hitting their only major league caliber starting player? Too much!!

There are unwritten rules that everyone needs to learn to follow or face the consequences!

- Hit a team with pitches too much, they will retaliate
- Return the cart to the cart corral after you unload it or the store manager will key your car
- Clean your browser history or HR will suggest that you get neutered


The thing about hitting Contreras is that he is such a likable player, like Yadier Molina, or Ty Cobb.

What are Brewers fans gong to do next year when Molina is retired and Contreras is dealt at the deadline to some other team.

What NL Central catcher will take the mantle of "most likeable opponent"?
You, Tyler Stephenson?
You, Roberto Perez?
You, Lieutenant Weinberg??

Counsell didn't order the Code Red, he's just trying to win games by pitching guys in their weak spots, and Willson's is inside.

At lease when Rizzo got hit over and over again he took it like a man because he understands the game (and is quite an outspoken advocate for his own healthcare if you know what I mean). So to Willlllson and Cubs fans, quit yer bitchin'
