Honk, honk!

As an avid BCB comment reader (and double platinum member) I've noticed a lot of consternation about what the Brewers should do prior to the end of August with their roster. There is a belief that improvements could be made to help the team now, and for a potential playoff run.

Some decisions are easy, like demoting Abraham Toro (.444 / .524 / .778 OPS+252) and replacing him with Rowdy Tellez (.210 / .288 / .382 OPS+82) . There isn't an Abraham Toro bobblehead day coming up, is there? Yeah, I didn't think so!

Rowdy's bobblehead includes his 2 dogs (true story). I wonder what Abraham's would look like? Maybe him on the end of a bench or doing needlepoint? Either way, note to the promotions team for next year, get the player bobblehead giveaways in BEFORE the trade deadline. You really tied management's hands with this one.

I posted Rowdy's batting stats above, but they don't tell the whole story, his speed, defense, and cribbage playing are where he really shines.

Astute fans may remember that Brian Anderson is still on the team. It has become increasingly unclear why, but one can assume career minor-leaguer Andruw Monster Stereo may need a breather one of these days.

This brings us to the real rub. There is someone toiling in the minors that can help the team today. Everyone is pointing out that they have nothing to lose by plugging him in the lineup right now. Sure his defense isn't that good, and he's had his chances before, but why not just get him on the roster and see what happens?

Of course I'm talking about Jesse Winker. Did you know that he recently went 1-3 against the Cedar Rapids Kernels? Remember that home run he hit this year? I bet he could do it again! (in another 197 plate appearances)

Why the management refuses to infuse the team with someone who has proven to hit at this level before is just befuddling. He's not going to be on the team next year anyway, just roll the dice and see what happens. We here at BCB have this figured out, what's taking them so long?
