Honk, honk!

It's been a while since I've written a Fan Post as I have been busy practicing my kazoo and updating the insipid JWA tracker.

On that note, Adrian Houser made a splash this week with a 4 inning performance after Corbin Burnes got his pants pulled down by the Diamondbacks. Unfortunately for Adrian, the current qualifying IP is 7 and those were his first 4, also he is named after Rocky's wife who worked at a pet shop, but I digress.

The current leader (and only qualifier) is Bryce Wilson with an incredible 11 JWAIP for the low, low price of $30,422.22 each. Look for Trevor Megill to challenge him for the title in the second half. Trevor has 6 JWAIP and was angling for more as he imploded in the 9th yesterday only to be replaced by Wilson (BURN!). Trevor has what I believe is the perfect profile for the JWA, not good, but not Varland terrible, tempting stuff that will get him chance after chance to show that he's, well, not good.

There's been a lot of talk on here about what the Brewers can do to either salvage this season, or blow it up like a Chinese spy balloon. Firstly I should point out that over my 2 years of watching baseball this is the worst Brewers team I've seen. They thought they had BLR players who knew their plan of BOTA, instead they seem to have a lot of NRFPTP who can't FTAWTHAAM. These scrubs are led by Jesse Winker who is a notorious Brewers' killer. Jesse's HR this week just shows what lengths he'll go to to thwart the Brewers. Without it he may already be on his way to the Jon Singleton Home for Useless DHs, but now he'll continue to kill the Brewers from the inside, not unlike the TidePod I had for lunch.

What can they do? Well for starters they need to trade for Brent Suter. He's left handed, can play baseball, and quite the dancer!

Next, start firing people, and not Counsell, not yet, make him sweat it out. Start with Bob Kozlowski. Why? Because nobody will see it coming! Don't even tell anyone (except for Bob of course) So when Sunday comes around and they pan to the area where Bob will be singing God Bless America, there will only be silence! THAT will get their attention! Then you fire Jason Lane and Lane Grindle. You could even have fun with it and say we fired Jason Lane Grindle (also fire Jennifer Jason Leigh, what has she done since Fast Times at Ridgemont High really?) This will put the fear of god into em!

Now that you've got their attention you set up a players-only meeting, but you only invite Andruw Montesario. When he shows up, and he's the only player there you tell him that maybe if he played better other players would invite him to the actual meeting (which of course doesn't exist). This will get Montesario to play at an All-Star level and won't require them to trade any of their incredible assets such as Bennett Sousa or Abraham Toro.

These moves, as well as trading Owen Miller for Shohei Ohtani will make the Brewers World Series champs. Make it happen suckas!!!
