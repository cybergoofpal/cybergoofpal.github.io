Honk, honk!

Now that the season (and postseason) is over (boo, apples, boo!), it’s time to go through the final stats for the first official BCB Joe Winklesas Award.

For those of you who don’t know about the JWA, or couldn’t be bothered to pay attention, it’s the award given to the Brewers reliever that produced the most budget-conscious useless innings eating over the course of the season. These innings are defined by the team being up by 5 or more runs, or down by 4 or more. This definition applied to over 127 innings this season.

It took me a while to decide a qualifying JWA innings pitched total. I settled on 1 for every 10 games played, or 16 for the season. I reserve the right to modify that next season to 16 or highest amount pitched as only one pitcher eclipsed 16 JWA IP this season.

I’d like to start by thanking all who participated, especially those who are no longer with the organization: Javy Guerra, Jake Cousins, Gus Varland, Tyson Miller, JC Mejia, Peter Strezlecki, Bennett Sousa, Mike Brosseau, Julio Tehran, and everybody’s favorite, Matt F’ing Bush. Your contributions, not unlike your names, could easily be forgotten (and probably will).

That leaves 16 others that pitched when everybody just wanted the game over already. Some of these were shuttled from Nashville specifically for the purpose of giving the "good" pitchers a break. Think Thyago Vieira (1 JWA IP), Ethan Small (3 JWA IP) J.B. Bukauskas (4 JWA IP) or Clayton Andrews (2/3 JWA IP). (Clayton is a case study in how you need to get "outs" to accumulate JWA IP or any innings pitched really)

There were several starters who ended up accumulating JWA IP in the off-start relief appearance- Colin Rea (2/3 JWA IP), Adrian Houser (5 JWA IP) and Eric Lauer (1 JWA IP).

Other than the aforementioned Mike Brosseau (2 1/3 JWA IP) the only other position player to get one was rodeo clown Rowdy Tellez (1 JWA IP).

The remaining contestants were regular bullpen members who just needed some work- Devin Williams (3 1/3 JWA IP); Were god-awful deadline pickups- Andrew Chafin (7 JWA IP!); Were transitioned from low-leverage to high leverage- Joel Payamps (8 JWA IP), Elvis Pegeuro (6 JWA IP) and Abner Uribe (5 JWA IP).

This leaves the top 3 JWA innings eaters.

Number 3 just pitched a lot in general, he also bailed out several of those above. With 11 2/3 JWA, Hoby Milner. Hoby didn’t qualify, but if he did his $87,907.38 per JWA IP would have him pretty far down the list. Minerva’s man brings home the bacon!

Our runner up also didn’t qualify, pitching only 12 JWA innings. Given his relatively small amount of time on the roster, his low salary would’ve had him winning, but he improved to the point of pitching high leverage and ruining his chances. With $32,258.33 per JWA, Trevor Megill.

That leaves our winner, and only qualifier, Bryce Wilson. What can I say about Bryce Wilson that hasn’t been said already? He was good enough to be on the roster all season, but not good enough to work his way out of mostly low leverage appearances. Couple this with a $732,600 salary and you’ve got JWA GOLD Jerry! With an incredible 21 JWA IP at $34,885.71 each he is the winner going away.

For those of you handicapping the JWA next year, being out of options sure helps (Wilson), but being terrible will get you gone (Vargas, Guerra, et al.).

Now just sit back and enjoy the off-season while we all ponder where Hunter Renfroe will end up next.
