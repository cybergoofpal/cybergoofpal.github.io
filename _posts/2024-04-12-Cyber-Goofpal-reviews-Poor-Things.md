# Cyber Goofpal reviews Poor Things

Honk, honk!

In an effort to see a variety of “good” movies, Mrs. Goofpal has lobbied to watch some of the movies nominated for Best Picture by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts, Sciences, and Overall Hoity-Toity Snobbishness. I’ve already reviewed Oppenheimer, which, dare I say, was the bomb. This installment is a review of Poor Things.

To be quite honest, I didn’t know what I was getting into when I agreed to watch Poor Things. I knew it starred Emma Stone, and who doesn’t love Emma Stone? Well, in this movie, everybody loves Emma Stone (if you know what I mean).

The movie starts out innocently enough with Emma’s character throwing herself off a bridge. After some bizarre Frankenstein-like re-animation operation implanting the brain of her unborn baby into her head, Bella Baxter is “born” and we are off to the crazy races. This operation is performed by a character named Dr. Godwin Baxter, or God for short (not making that up) played by William Dafoe. Post operation Bella has the body of Emma Stone with the brain of an infant (Like a Kardashian).

Although she’s not house-trained, one of Dr. God’s pupils (Max) tasked with babysitting her falls in love with her and intends to marry her, presumably not for her conversational skills.

As she develops mentally Bella discovers the joys of self love, and begins to “honk” like there is no tomorrow. Due to her beauty and ahem, agreeable nature, she is soon whisked away by Duncan Wedderburn, played by the terrible Mark Ruffalo. Duncan, who was supposed to be the lawyer finalizing her nuptial contract with Max, brings her on a journey reminiscent of (spoiler alert) Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh on their honeymoon in Gone with the Wind.

This trip had far more honking than Gone with the Wind. Bella and Duncan honked like this, they honked like that, they honked with a wiffle ball bat. I don’t usually use big words like gratuitous, so I won’t here, but man there was a whole lot of honking going on.

When Bella takes a break from honking, she sees the world isn’t that great of a place so she does the charitable thing and gives away all of Duncan’s money to the poor. He gets institutionalized and in a classic case of “find a job you love and you’ll never work a day in your life” she finds a job at a brothel in France. There, more honking ensues including with a new friend, fellow prostitute Toinette.

Eventually Bella’s actual first husband (before she threw herself off the bridge and changed personalities by getting a brain transplant from her unborn child (keep up!)) Alfie, finds her and is a total jag-bag. After she throws a sedative in his face that he demanded she drink at gunpoint, he shoots himself in the foot and passes out.

By this point Dr. God is dead, but Bella has gotten so smart she is able to do the brain-transplanty thing and switches Alfie’s brain with that of a goat, and as they say, everyone lives happily ever after.
