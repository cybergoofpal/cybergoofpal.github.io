Honk, honk!

Ever since the Suter deal went down I've been pretty down in the mouth. My friends have been trying to cheer me up using all manner of tricks.

Barrellman got me one of those cakes where the woman pops out, but it was Rosie O' Donnell; Come on Barrellman!!!

Bernie Brewer suggested that I do an off-season mailbag here on BCB as you guys (and possibly some gals?) have always been so generous with your Recs. (You'll remember that 4% of all Recs received are donated to mascot-specific charities such as the Ronald McDonald House and Gritty's Hostel for the Criminally Insane).

This was a nice suggestion by Bernie, and although he didn't actually get me anything, it was an improvement over getting Rosie O'Donnell a robe, and getting her the hell out of my house.

So the rules for questions are: There are no rules. As you know from my posts I am a baseball expert, but if you want to know literally anything, like what does a Tide Pod taste like, I'll oblige. Like Jack's mailbags I'll pick and choose what I want to answer, but you can be assured as a vessel of love, I will try my best.

Yours Honkily,
