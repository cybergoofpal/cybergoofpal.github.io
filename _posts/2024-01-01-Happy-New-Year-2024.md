# Honk, honk!

Happy New Year and welcome to the new Cybergoofpal.fun website.  I’d like to start this commentary by sharing some New Year’s resolutions:

1. Start blog site
2. Invite BCB members to visit
3. Thank both of them for coming
4. Lose about 30 pounds by the end of January
5. Investigate a “Dry January” by not showering
6. Walk the dog twice a day whether he likes it or not
7. Cut down on my drinking by using larger ice cubes
8. Quit my job at the pet store / see if Rocky Rococo’s will take me back
9. Make my bed every morning (make sure Mrs. Goofpal is out first)
10. Stop procrastinating to finish…
