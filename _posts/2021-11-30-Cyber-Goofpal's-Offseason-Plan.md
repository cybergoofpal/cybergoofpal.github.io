Honk, Honk! I think I've followed baseball for long enough now to put this together. Here goes.

- Omar Narvaez: $4.1M-Tender

- Willie Adames: $4.0M- Tender

- Luis Urias: $2.4M- Tender

- Dan Vogelbach: $2.0M-Non Tender

- Rowdy Tellez: $1.9M- Tender

- Jace Peterson: $1.3M- Non Tender

- Brandon Woodruff: $7.1M- Tender

- Corbin Burnes: $4.0M- Tender

- Eric Lauer: $2.7M- Tender

- Adrian Houser: $2.3M- Tender

- Josh Hader: $10M- Tender

- Brent Suter: $2.3M- Negotiate 10 year deal at 5M a year

- Jandel Gustave: .8M- Tender

- Trades: The Brewers need a bat for the outfield to replace Avi Garcia.

Trade JBJ, Yelich, and Houser to the Angels for Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani. The Angels get 3 players for 2. Great deal for them. Brewers get a solid outfielder and starting pitcher.

They'll need an additional outfielder to replace JBJ / Yelich.

Trade Gustave to the Pirates for Brian Reynolds. Pirates realize they made a mistake in letting him go.

Address the 1B issue.

Sign Kris Bryant. He can play there when Rowdy is tired.

Add a pitcher that you can rehab into an excellent reliever:

Sign Steven Brault. The snakeskin tattoo tells me this guy is for real.

I'm sure you will all poke holes in this, but this would be a good team!
