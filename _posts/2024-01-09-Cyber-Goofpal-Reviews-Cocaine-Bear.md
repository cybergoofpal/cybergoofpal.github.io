Honk, honk!

For my inaugural article for this website, I’d like to do a movie review of 2023’s Cocaine Bear.  Not to be confused with Marijuana Bear, a yet to be released documentary on Rashan Salaam.  Don’t be too concerned about any spoilers you may encounter in the synopsis below as I actually watched this maybe 6 months ago and I don’t remember it very well.  Also, I may or may not have fallen asleep during some of it, and, most importantly, it’s a movie about a bear on cocaine, pretty self-explanatory.

There’s been a lot of complaints about the lack of creativity coming out of Hollywood.  You can’t hardly have a bowel movement without another superhero movie coming out.  I mean Batman & Robin, Ant Man & the Wasp, Crazy Ira and the Douche.  It never ends.  This is why I was so disappointed to see the release of Cocaine Bear.  I mean hasn’t this ground already been covered by Marijuana Moose and Bourbon Badger?

For those of you that don’t know, Cocaine Bear is a “Horror / Comedy” fancifully based on an actual incident where in 1985 an American black bear ingested several kilograms of a lost bag containing about 75 pounds of cocaine.   The bear in question is actually on display at the Fun Mall in Lexington, KY and nicknamed “Pablo Escobear” (zing!).  I’m going to assume that the bear is deceased and that this is a taxidermy replica as having a cocaine-addled bear in a mall would make it less than “fun”.

Anyhoo, this movie imagines a scenario where a drug smuggler attempts to parachute from his plane with a drug filled duffel bag.  He unwittingly falls to his death and the cocaine filled duffel bag falls into the forest to the delight of an American black bear looking to score.  This bear, after getting a taste for cocaine, becomes quite aggressive, and frankly, no fun to be around.  The rest of the film really writes itself, or at least I hope that’s what happened, because, wow, it’s bad.

I know what you’re thinking, “Goofpal, what did you expect?  It’s an entire movie about a bear on cocaine!”  That’s the beauty though, lean into it.  Have the bear work on Wall Street, maybe become a prostitute or a stripper.  Film it like a David Attenborough nature documentary and have the bear accidentally leave his cocaine in the White House.  There’s just so much you could do with it.   I was hoping for “so bad it’s good” like Sharknado, but instead I got “What the hell was I thinking, this clearly is going to suck” like Hot Tub Time Machine.

There are humans in the movie too.  (Sidebar: I’ve noticed most movies have humans in them).  The humans include Keri Russell who really is good in anything (except this because it is such garbage).  She plays Sari, a nurse and a mother of one the two stupid kids who do some of the cocaine and artfully evade the bear.  I kept wanting Keri Russell to be Elizabeth from The Americans again.  She’d kick that Bear’s ass after sleeping with it and gaining access to highly classified documents.

An additional human in the movie was Ray Liotta.  This may come as a surprise to those familiar with Liotta’s body of work, but he plays a gangster. (Sidebar: You may remember Liotta for his seminal gangster role in 1995’s Operation Dumbo Drop).  Sadly, this was Liotta’s last film.  A bit like Steve Carlton finishing his career with the Twins.  Rest in Peace Ray.

There were other humans as well.  I can’t be bothered to go through all of them, especially the child “actors”, one of whom was kidnapped by the bear (not making that up) .  The characters were so stupid and unlikable they had me rooting for the bear if you know what I mean. There were a lot of characters, and they needed all of them as it was necessary to have one mauled about every 15 minutes or so.  

The CGI bear, and later, her cubs (SPOILER!) didn’t look real to me.  I mean they’re more realistic than Yogi and Boo-Boo, but just slightly.  Although one of them was shot, all the bears manage to survive, just in case a potentially profitable sequel were to come their way.  

The great thing about living in these modern times is that you can stream just about anything you want to watch if you are willing to pay for it.  Currently you could stream Cocaine Bear on Amazon Prime for $9.99. For the love of god, don’t.
