![Gary Sanchez](images/gary.jpeg)

Honk, honk!

As most of you ardent Brewers followers know, it was reported that the Brewers were to sign Gary Sanchez to a one year 7MM deal. This came out on February 7th. 10 full days from this writing, and the deal has still not been made official.

This has lead to a lot of speculation as to what is the hold up. The obvious answer is that the Brewers found something they didn’t like in his physical. But, the most obvious answer is never the correct one. Sidebar: This is known as "Goofpal’s Razor".

Do you remember what else was happening around February 7th? Brew Crew Ball was accepting applications for a new writer. In fact, applications needed to be emailed no later than February 9th. Coincidence? I think not!

You may have gleaned from the postings and comment sections that eddiematthews (not the actual Eddie Matthews, as he is dead) has applied for the open writing position. The more astute among you may have "read through the lines" or "have some common sense" and determined that I too, have applied for this position. As of today, neither of us has even received a confirmation of receipt of our applications.

There’s really only one conclusion that you can draw from this: Gary Sanchez is the new writer on Brew Crew Ball.

It all adds up when you think about it. Gary was set to make only $7 million with the Brewers for an in-person, full time position, where he will likely make much more for BCB in this paid, remote, part-time contract position, with a monthly stipend. He also has access to all the players, whereas someone like me or eddie would have to make up conversations that we had with players. Sidebar: Did you know Sal Frelick prefers fritos over funyons? Isn’t that fantastic?

So let me be the first to welcome Gary to BCB, and Harrison, If you are looking for a way to let me down easy, I suggest the following email:

Dear Mr. Goofpal,

Thank you for your application. We regret to inform you that we will not be offering you a position with BCB due to the following (in no particular order): You did not supply a writing sample; You did not supply a resume; Your writing frequently contains facts that aren’t true; Your baseball knowledge appears to be that of a 3rd grader; We don’t have the time or inclination to read through your nonsense to verify we won’t get sued; Brent Suter is no longer on the Brewers; You didn’t supply an actual name (we know your name isn’t really Cyber Goofpal), and most importantly, you are not Gary Sanchez.

We hope you continue to provide us with free semi-amusing content without promoting your website (https://cybergoofpal.fun/)

Hugs and Kisses,

Harrison Freuck

For anyone reading this article that maybe would like eddie or dare I say, me to write for BCB, I’ve just been told that Gary Sanchez failed his physical with Vox. Post your preference in the comments section below and perhaps the management will give this some consideration.
