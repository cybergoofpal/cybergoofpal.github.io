Honk, honk!

As all of you astute BCB readers know the site has recently changed it's focus to the Tigers and to a lesser extent, the Giants. I could explain why this is, but it would be boring and probably not make any sense, kinda like an episode of the last season of Lost.

Anyhoo, The Tigers, what is there to say that hasn't been said, they're cats, big cats, big striped cats. Unlike normal cats they are not completely uninterested in people. This is because they want to eat you. Did you know that if you wear a mask on the back of your head that looks like your face a tiger won't attack you because they are an ambush predator who thinks that you are looking at them? This works, I know because I've been doing it for years and have never been attacked by a tiger. Granted, it was here in Wisconsin, but still... I wonder if the Detroit Tigers baseball team should consider this as a promotion, you could have a tigers hat with a big flap on the back that looks like your face. I suppose that they couldn't hand out ones who looked exactly like each person so they would have to get a "typical face" (maybe Christian Yelich???)

And the Giants. That is a scary team name. Giants do exist, just there aren't that many of them.

Andre the Giant surprisingly never played for the Giants. He did drink 156 beers in one sitting one time, which makes sense if you like beer like I do. Sadly he died before the Tide Pods eating craze came out.This is his hand palming a beer.

He did have some Brewers connections outside of being a raging drunk. He was a good friend of Bob Uecker as shown here:

The Iron Giant also never played for the Giants, but imagine if he did. Sure he could hit the ball a mile and run the bases in 4 strides, but could he ever get on? Huge strike zone (even bigger if he has two strikes and Angel Hernandez is the home plate ump), really slow swing. On D I'm thinking first base. Big Target. You won't see Manny Machado trying to kick his shin going past the bag, that's for sure. Oh well, we'll never know because nobody watched that movie.

You may think this is nonsense, but I'm just trying to keep up with what's current here. Go Tigergiants!!!
