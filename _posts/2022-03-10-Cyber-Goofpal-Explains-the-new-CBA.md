Honk, Honk! Well we finally are going to have baseball back, and not a moment too soon. If they would've waited any longer to come to a deal the owners would have had to come up with some kind of deadline for cancelling regular season games. Wait, what, I'm being told there was a deadline, wait, 4 deadlines? Certainly regular season games will be cancelled then. No? Confusing, right?

A lot of "news" has leaked out by some "experts" with "credentials" and "actual identities" but I have the real story, not from first hand knowledge, but from my mole, High High Heat.

Rule Changes:

- Bases will be larger for safety, 6 feet by 6 feet. They will also have advertisements on them for additional marketing. In some games the bases will be actual Michelin tires as they are a sponsor.
- Universal DH. We all knew this was coming, but did you know that they are all from the Milky Way? Probably not.
- Banning of the Shift. All bullpen cars and service vehicles will now be fully automatic. The MLB pushed for full push-button ignitions, but the players wouldn't go for it. Maybe in the next CBA

Financials and other hoo-ha:

- Minimum Player Salary goes to $700,000. This way players don't have to work odd jobs in the off-season to make ends meet. They can focus on staying in shape and Fortnite.
- Pre-Arbitration pool of money- $50MM. They haven't said how this will be distributed yet, but I know. All players who receive votes from the baseball writers association will receive a pro-rated portion, minus the bribes that they pay to the sportswriters to vote for them. The players pushed for a bigger pool as the writers should clear about 20MM in bribes.
- Playoffs are now 12 teams. This is confusing a lot of people so let me break it down for you: Everybody with a winning record makes the playoffs and the tiny series' make getting to the WS a complete crap shoot. Enjoy! There was some debate about having a "ghost win" but the players decided they wanted the scariest thing to be Trevor Bauer's personal life.
- Other incentives are in there to prevent teams from "tanking". Teams that bring up good players who bribe sportswriters and finish first and second for ROY will get extra draft picks. Teams that bring up bad players will be the Orioles and Pirates.
- Finally the MLB got the players to drop their 500MM grievance over the 2020 season. They have agreed to have this settled in the People's Court. Don't believe me, ask Doug Llewelyn, he interviewed Rob Manfred just a short while ago.

Welcome back baseball! Now someone sign Daniel Norris for Christ Sakes!
